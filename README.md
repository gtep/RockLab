# RockLab

RockLab is a result manager for tests performed in a rock laboratory.


### 1. Installation

Download and run the file: [RockLab_Installer.bat][1]

Or open your cmd and type:

	git clone https://github.com/gtep/RockLab.git

It will create a RockLab folder with a RockLab.exe inside.

If you do not have git installed, download RockLab manually from the Realeases tab
on the right side. Unzip the file and use RockLab as usual.

### 2. License

In case you do not have a license, a notification window will be displayed at
program startup. Request a license by sending an e-mail with the settings
(machine id and product id) by clicking on the "send e-mail" button.

Updates are only available for installations that used the installer.
Run *RockLab_Updater.bat* in the *scripts* folder to update RockLab.
